# Overview of the school district analysis
##  Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to analyze the data on student funding and standarized test scores of PyCity School district. The school board has notified that some of the students were caught with academic dishonesty from Thomas High School and because of that we are doing the school district analysis again by replacing the math and reading scores of ninth graders from the Thomas High School. 



# Results:
- **How is the district summary affected?**,

Before replacing ninth grade, Thomas High School was one of the top 5 (2nd place) schools but after it did not make it to top 5 school list.

       - Math and reading scores by grade

t
       - Scores by school spending
       - Scores by school size
        - Scores by school type
