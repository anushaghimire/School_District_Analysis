# Overview of the school district analysis
##  Purpose 
The purpose of the study is to analyze the data on student funding and standarized test scores of PyCity School district. The school board has notified that some of the students were caught with academic dishonesty from Thomas High School and because of that we are doing the school district analysis again by replacing the math and reading scores of ninth graders from the Thomas High School. 



# Results:
- **How is the district summary affected?**,

After dropping the scores of ninth grade, we can see that there was no difference on passing math score and the passing reading score.

We can see that the overall passing percentage increased from 65% to 90.6%. But there was no difference in average reading score. Similarly the percentage of math score and percentage reading score increased from 67 to 93% and from 69.6 to 97% respectively. 

- **How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**
Before replacing ninth grade, Thomas High School was one of the top 5 (2nd place) schools but after it did not make it to top 5 school list.

-    **How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:**
       - Math and reading scores by grade

t
       - Scores by school spending
       - Scores by school size
        - Scores by school type
